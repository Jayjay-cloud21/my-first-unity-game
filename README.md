# BirdGame1

Hi, my name is Pee Jay and BirdGame1 is the first game I have ever made. This game resembles the famous "Flappy Bird" with its mechanics and design. I developed this game to be more familiar with Unity's services, packages, and to become more proficient in C#.

**Play the Game:**

### **Mechanics**
- Press the play game option from the main menu to get started.
- Use the spacebar to get through the gap between two poles.
- Getting through the gaps gives the player a point.
- Keep playing until the bird dies.
- The bird dies when it goes way out of bounds or it hits a pole.
- Press the quit button to exit the application.
